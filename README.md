# go-metrics
A simple program to check up some functional and structural metrics of the go code


The purpose of the code above is obvious, but still:


The program does metrological estimation of the code in the "main.go" file. It also checks the execution time of the program.

Paste the code to execute inside the main() function and enjoy! The filename of the code file can also be changed there.
